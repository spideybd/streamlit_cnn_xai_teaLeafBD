**CSE 366 â€” Artificial Intelligence**
**Group Assignment: Streamlit App with Model Selection & XAI Visualizations**

Dataset: teaLeafBD (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/744vznw5k2/4)

Features implemented in the streamlit app:

**Model Selection**: Choose among custom CNN, ResNet-152, DenseNet-201 and EfficientNet-B3.
**Image Input**: Upload your own image or select from provided samples from each disease class.
**Prediction**: Get the top 3 predicted classes with their confidence scores for 7 different tea leaf conditions.
**XAI Visualizations**: Generate and compare five different explanations (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM, Ablation-CAM, LIME)
**Export**: Download all generated explanation images as a .zip file.

**Setup steps(Assuming for windows):**

1.  Create a Virtual Environment:
    **bash**
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

2.  Install Dependencies:
    **bash**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  Download the dataset from [https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/744vznw5k2/4] and place it in the same folder as the .py files.

4.  Download and Place Model Weights:
    Place the trained model weights into the `/weights` directory. These are the files that would store the weights:
    1. custom_cnn.pth
    2. resnet152.pth
    3. densenet201.pth
    4. efficientnet_b3.pth

**Run the app and feature exploration**

1.  Run the Streamlit App:
    **bash**
    streamlit run app.py

2.  Open the URL provided by Streamlit in your browser.

3. Use the sidebar to select a model and an input image.

4. Click the "Generate All Explanations" button to view the XAI visualizations.

5. Download all generated explanation images as a .zip file by clicking "Download all generated visualizations as a single ZIP file."

**MODEL LIST**
